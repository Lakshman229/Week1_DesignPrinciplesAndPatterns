# 🚗 Vehicle Factory Pattern Implementation

A clean Java implementation of the **Factory Design Pattern** demonstrating object creation for different vehicle types.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Vehicle Interface**: Common contract for all vehicles
- **Concrete Implementations**: `Car`, `Bike`, and `Motorcycle` classes
- **VehicleFactory**: Centralized object creation logic
- **Maven Support**: Easy build and execution
- **JUnit Tests**: 85% test coverage
